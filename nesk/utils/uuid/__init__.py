"""
A universally unique identifier (UUID) is a 128-bit label used for information
in computer systems. The term globally unique identifier (GUID) is also used.

When generated according to the standard methods, UUIDs are, for practical
purposes, unique. Their uniqueness does not depend on a central registration
authority or coordination between the parties generating them, unlike most
other numbering schemes. While the probability that a UUID will be duplicated
is not zero, it is close enough to zero to be negligible.

Anyone can create a UUID and use it to identify with near certainty that
the identifier does not duplicate one that has already been, or will be,
created to identify something else. Information labeled with UUIDs by
independent parties can therefore be later combined into a single database
or transmitted on the same channel, with a negligible probability of
duplication.

Adoption of UUIDs is widespread, with many computing platforms providing
support for generating them and for parsing their textual representation.

UUIDs are generally used for identifying information that needs to be unique
within a system or network thereof. Their uniqueness and low probability in
being repeated makes them useful for being associative keys in databases and
identifiers for physical hardware within an organization.
